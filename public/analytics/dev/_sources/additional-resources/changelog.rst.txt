Changelog
=========

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on `Keep a Changelog <https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/>`__.

0.2.1 - 2022-04-14
------------------

Added
~~~~~

-  Added support for basic operations (filter, map, etc.) on Spark date and timestamp columns. ``ColumnType`` has two new variants, ``DATE`` and ``TIMESTAMP``, to support these.
-  Future documentation will include any exceptions defined in Analytics.

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  Switch session to use Persist/Unpersist instead of Cache.

.. _section-1:

0.2.0 - 2022-03-28
------------------

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  Multi-query evaluate support is entirely removed.
-  Columns that are neither floats nor doubles will no longer be checked for NaN values.
-  The ``BIT`` variant of the ``ColumnType`` enum was removed, as it was not supported elsewhere in Analytics.

.. _changed-1:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  *Backwards-incompatible*: Renamed ``query_exprs`` parameter in ``Session.evaluate`` to ``query_expr``.
-  *Backwards-incompatible*: ``QueryBuilder.join_public`` and the ``JoinPublic`` query expression can now accept public tables specified as Spark dataframes. The existing behavior using public source IDs is still supported, but the ``public_id`` parameter/property is now called ``public_table``.
-  Installation on Python 3.7.1 through 3.7.3 is now allowed.
-  KeySets now do type coercion on creation, matching the type coercion that Sessions do for private sources.
-  Sessions created by ``partition_and_create`` must be used in the order they were created, and using the parent session will forcibly close all child sessions. Sessions can be manually closed with ``session.stop()``.

Fixed
~~~~~

-  Joining with a public table that contains no NaNs, but has a column where NaNs are allowed, previously caused an error when compiling queries. This is now handled correctly.

.. _section-2:

0.1.1 - 2022-02-28
------------------

.. _added-1:

Added
~~~~~

-  Added a ``KeySet`` class, which will eventually be used for all GroupBy queries.
-  Added ``QueryBuilder.groupby()``, a new group-by based on ``KeySet``\ s.

.. _changed-2:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  The Analytics library now uses ``KeySet`` and ``QueryBuilder.groupby()`` for all
   GroupBy queries.
-  The various ``Session`` methods for loading in data from CSV no longer support loading the data’s schema from a file.
-  Made Session return a more user-friendly error message when the user provides a privacy budget of 0.
-  Removed all instances of the old name of this library, and replaced them with “Analytics”

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``QueryBuilder.groupby_domains()`` and ``QueryBuilder.groupby_public_source()`` are now deprecated in favor of using ``QueryBuilder.groupby()`` with ``KeySet``\ s.
   They will be removed in a future version.

.. _section-3:

0.1.0 - 2022-02-15

Added
